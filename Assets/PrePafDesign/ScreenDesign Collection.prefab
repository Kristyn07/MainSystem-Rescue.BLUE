    over disaster and emergency situations, and to provide a framework for communities
    to avoid, cope with, or recover from the impact of disasters.
  - 'Risks from global climate change are further exacerbating the country''s vulnerability
    to natural hazards. '
  - 'Environmental degradation has hugely contributed to increasing natural disaster
    occurrence in the Philippines. '

    neighbors who may require special assistance such as infants, the elderly and
    people with access and functional needs. Give first aid where appropriate. Do
    not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further
    injury. Call for help.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - AFTER: Watch out for fallen power lines or broken gas lines
    and stay out of damaged areas. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - AFTER: Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most
    common hazard after an earthquake. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - AFTER: Each time you feel an aftershock, drop, cover and hold
    on. Aftershocks frequently occur for minutes, days, weeks and even months following
    an earthquake. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - AFTER: Expect and prepare for potential aftershocks, landslides
    or even a tsunami. Tsunamis are often generated by earthquakes in coastal areas.  '

    and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses,
    and utility wires.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If outdoors, Stay there until the shaking stops. The
    greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits and alongside exterior
    walls. Many fatalities from earthquakes occur when people run outside of buildings
    only to be killed by falling debris from collapsing walls. Ground movement during
    an earthquake is seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquake
    related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.  '

  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, use stairs - do not use elevators.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, stay inside until the shaking stops and
    it is safe to go outside. Do not exit a building during the shaking. Research
    has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move
    to a different location inside the building or try to leave. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, do not use a doorway except if you know
    it is a strongly supported, load-bearing doorway and it is close to you. Many
    inside doorways are lightly constructed and do not offer protection. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake
    strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a
    heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, stay away from glass, windows, outside
    doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - DURING: If indoors, drop to the ground; take cover by getting
    under a solid table or other piece of furniture; and hold on until the shaking
    stops. If there is not a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with
    your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Hold earthquake drills with your family members: Drop,
    cover and hold on. '
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Locate safe spots in each room under a solid table
    or against an inside wall. Reinforce this information by moving to these places
    during drills.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Store weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products
    securely in closed cabinets with latches and on bottom shelves. Lock these if

    leaky gas connections. These are potential fire risks. Get appropriate professional
    help. Do not work with gas or electrical lines yourself.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Brace overhead light fixtures and top-heavy objects.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Fasten heavy items such as pictures and mirrors securely
    to walls and away from beds, couches and anywhere people sit.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Store breakable items such as bottled foods, glass,
    and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Fasten shelves securely to walls.'
  - 'EARTHQUAKE TIP - BEFORE: Build an emergency/evacuation kit and make a family
    communication plan including a list of essential numbers.'

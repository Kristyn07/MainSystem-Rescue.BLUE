    sentences:
    - Attention, new recruits! I have been informed ahead of time of your assessment
      test results, and all of you met the standards requirements with flying colors.
    - Remember who you all are! You are BLUEs! Your job is to save and protect people
      from natural disasters regardless of scope, size, and severity.
    - You in particular are of note. You ranked with a grade of 99 in the assessment
      test, by far the best of this batch.
    - You all clearly have the knowledge and smarts to do what must be done. Let's
      see if you can put it into practice!
    - We'll start with the basics. [Player], in the field our operatives rely on
      supplies from our first aid kits.
    - We have the means to deliver these supplies remotely in the event that there
      is a supply shortage in the field.
    - Sometimes, it might be up to you and others to resupply our operatives' kits
      in the field.
    - 'So it is important to understand what is needed and what they need now. '
    - 'You will also need to understand important bandaging techniques to be able
      to tend to injured people when the time comes. '
    - Given you're still a rookie, we'll start you and the others off with basic
      bandaging techniques and improve from there.
    - Rescue.BLUE is known for its prestige as a search-and-rescue operation, and
      thus we have a reputation to uphold and maintain.
    - If we show incompetence in our duties, our funding may be pulled and our reputation
      will be destroyed.
    - It is imperative that this does not happen.
    - I've said what I needed to say. Your training begins now. Godspeed and good
      luck, rookie.
